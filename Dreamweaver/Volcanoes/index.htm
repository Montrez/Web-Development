    <td><p>A volcano is a location on the surface of the Earth where magma has erupted out of the interior of the planet. Magma is molten rock, which has melted from the extreme heat and pressure inside the Earth. Molten rock on the Earth's surface face is called lava. As lava cools, it builds up and forms mountains.</p>
    <p>Volcanoes are classified as active or inactive. Avolcano is active if it is currently erupting or expected to erupt eventually. Inactive volcanoes are older and have usually erupted many times. </p>
    <p>A volcanic eruption occurs when lava, gasses, and other matter come out of a vent. Violent eruptions often include chunks of rock that were blown out off the interior walls of the vent. Quiet eruptions consist of lava flowing out of vents. </p>
    <p>Eventually, the volcano reaches the cooling stage. While the volcano cools, it reduces in size from erosion.</p></td>
