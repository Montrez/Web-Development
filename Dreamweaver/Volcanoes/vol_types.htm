    <td><p>Types of Volcanoes are formed from explosive eruptions where materials are ejected high in the air and cool before they hit the ground. Fine-grained rocks are blown away by winds. Coarser rock fragments remain in a cone-shaped pile, which can be hundreds of meter tall. </p>
    <p>Shield volcanoes are formed by frequent, quiet eruptions and are much larger in width that in height. As smooth lava flows build up, a dome shape is formed. Shield voclanoes usually change shape when eruptions become explosive late in the life of the volcano. </p>
    <p>Compositive volcanoes are very large and are formed from alternating explosive eruptions and quiet eruptions. This results in layers of ejected matieral covered by smooth lava flows. Composite volcanoes are usually symmetrical in shape and can be as high as several kilometers. </p></td>
