      <p>Coffee beans come from evergreen trees grown in a subtropical belt around the world. Coffee grows in more than 50 countries with warm, humid climates, at altitudes ranging from sea level to 6,000 feet and above. The three major growing regions are Latin America, Africa, and Indonesia. </p>
      <p>Coffee beans are actually seeds that are found inside the cherries of an evergreen plant. Two main species of coffee are: arabica and robusta.</p>
      <P>The arabica tree produces a fine quality coffee, which is sold by gourmet retailers. Arabica beans are delicate and flavorful and sell at higher prices because of their quality and limited availability. Because the arabica tree is susceptible to disease, frost, and drought, it requires the right climatic conditions. </P>
    <P>The robusta tree, which bears more coffee cherries, is hardier and more resistant to disease. Although generally not found in gourmet shops, robusta beans are often used in the processing of instant coffees and popular commercial blends. </P></td>
