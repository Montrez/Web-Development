    <td><h2>What is a portfolio?</h2>
      <p> A portfolio is a collection of work that clearly illustrates effort,
        progress, and achievement of knowledge and skills.</p>
      <h2> What form does it take?</h2>
      <p> Traditional portfolios typically take the form of a file folder or
        a three-ring binder. An electronic portfolio stores and presents portfolio
        content in a digital format such as a Web site.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Pages in both a traditional portfolio and an electronic portfolio Web
        site vary depending on the individual and the purpose of creating the
        portfolio. Examples of pages or heading that might be included on a portfolio
        designed for a job search are:</p>
      <p>Career Objective</p>
      <p> Education </p>
      <p> Extra-curricular Activities </p>
      <p> Work Experience </p>
      <p> Volunteer Work </p>
      <p>Hobbies </p>
      <p> Skills </p>
      <p> Awards/Achievements </p>
      <p> References</p>
      <h2>How is an electronic portfolio distributed?</h2>
      <p>Electronic portfolios can be burned to a CD to distribute with a paper
        r&eacute;sum&eacute;, which gives the potential employer a nice package
    of both printed and electronic information.</p></td>
