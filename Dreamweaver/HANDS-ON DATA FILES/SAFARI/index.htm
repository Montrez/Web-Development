        a habitat that is similar to their natural environment. It was opened to
        the public
        in 1985 and has undergone several expansions and improvement projects over
        the years.</p>
      <p>We have a variety of animals including tigers, lions, elephants,
          and giraffes. Successful breeding has maintained our population, which
          includes some
          endangered species. </p>
      <p>We run a variety of education programs and camps. Be sure to pick
          up a schedule of events when you visit us at Safari Park.<br>
