        The drive through Safari Park is 12 miles long. The time spent on the
        drive will vary, with a family spending an average of about three hours
        at the park. You may drive your own car through the park or have a tour
      guide take you through in a safari bus.</p>

        Natural Jungle Paradise Exhibit<br>
        Swamp Ride<br>

        On Saturdays and Sundays, we have an education presentation about the
        animals at 1 pm in the Safari Theatre. Educational classes for groups,
      such as a school field trip, can be arranged at our main office.</p>
