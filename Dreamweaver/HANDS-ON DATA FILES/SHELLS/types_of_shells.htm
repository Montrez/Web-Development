    <td>There are many different types of shells including these four:
      <p>Babylon Shells<br>
        Babylon shells are thick with brown blotches found on
          the outer shell. Most species are found in the tropical Indo-Pacific
          and live in shallow
      water.</p>
      <p>Cowries<br>
        Cowries have a glossy surface and come in a variety of beautiful
          colors. They are about 200 species of cowries and they are found mainly
          in
        the tropics.</p>
      <p>Frog Shells<br>
        Frog shells take on many shapes. Some have warty lumps which
          is why they are named frog shells. They are found in the tropical Indo-Pacific
        on the sand and in coral rubble.</p>
      <p>Scallops<br>
        Scallops are probably the best known of all seashells. They
          have a fan-shaped shell and are commonly found in the sand. There are
          many
            different
    species of scallops found all over the world.</p></td>
