      <p>Different types of sounds are made from different instruments. The vibration 
        produced from playing an instrument produces sound waves in the air. The 
        sound waves travel to our ears and cause our eardrums to vibrate in the 
        same pattern as the instrument being played. <br>
        Some instruments include trumpet, trombone, horn, tuba, clarinet, saxophone, 
        bagpipes, accordion, harmonica, flute, drums, bass, banjo, piano, violin, 
        guitar, harp, cello, cymbals, triangles, xylophones, gongs, chimes, and 
        rattles. Cultures all over the world have created musical instruments 
        by using the natural materials of their region (fiber, metal, reed, gut, 
        skin, and stone) to produce sound.</p>
      <p>Anthropologists have classified all musical instruments in five basic 
        categories:</p>
      <p>Aerophones are instruments that produce sound by a vibrating column of 
        air. These usually consist of a pipe made out of wood, metal, or plastic, 
        sometimes with a reed attached. Examples are flute, oboe, and clarinet.</p>
      <p>Idiophones are wood or metal percussion instruments that produce sound 
        by being struck, scraped, or shaken. Examples are gongs, cymbals, rattles, 
        and xylophones.</p>
      <p>Membranophones are instruments that produce sound by striking or rubbing 
        a skin or membrane stretched across a resonating air chamber. Examples 
        are conga drums and timpani.</p>
      <p>Chordophones are instruments that produce their sound through the vibration 
        of strings by being vowed, plucked, or struck. Examples are guitar, harp, 
        violin, and string bass.</p>
      <p>Electrophones are instruments that produce sounds from electricity. Examples 
        are electronic organs and synthesizers.<br>
