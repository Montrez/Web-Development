    <td>I recently visited the beautiful country of Greece. This trip was my
      first visit to Greece and hopefully will not be my last visit! I went to
      the island of Hydra (pronounced &quot;EE-druh&quot;) and traveled around
      an area known as the Peloponnese (pronounced &quot;pell-lo-pone-EECE&quot;).
      This site contains photographs I took as I traveled, and a chronological
    list of the places I visited.</td>
