    <td><p>Wind is any current of air. It can be as gentle as a breeze or as
        destructive as a hurricane. Wind measured on land is given in miles per
        hour, and wind
        measure at sea is in knots. The direction of a given wind is determined
        from the point of the compass from which it blows (for example, northeast,
        south). In parts of the world, names are given to seasonal winds of particular
        quality. For example, Santa Ana is a name given to a hot, dry wind that
        blows from the north or east in southern California.</p>
      <p>Wind can be measured using several methods and devices. The Beaufort
        Wind Scale is a commonly-used numeric scale for specifying the force
        of the wind used in
        all
        parts of the world (both on land and at sea.)
            It was devised by Admiral Francis Beaufort in 1806 for recording
        wind force at sea based on the effect of the wind on a
            full-rigged ship. An anemometer is a device with cups that
    spin from the force of the wind, and is used for determining wind speed.
    A weather vane is a lat object that rotates with the wind and shows wind
        direction. A wind sock is commonly seen at an airport. Wind socks show
        direction and speed of the wind.</p></td>
