    <td><p>Three types of storms are tornados, hurricanes, and tropical storms.</p>
      <p>A
          tornado is a small and short-lived but very severe windstorm. They
        often accompany thunderstorms, rain, and hail and have whirling columns
            of air and wind speeds up to 300 mph. They can cause tremendous damage.
            The diameter of an average tornado is between 500 and 2,000 feet,
        and
            the average tornado moves along the ground at 28 mph. In the United
        States, approximately 750 tornadoes are reported every year.</p>
      <p>A hurricane
        is a huge tropical rainstorm with winds that swirl around a calm, dry
        central &quot;eye.&quot; Wind speeds must be more than 74
        mph for a tropical storm to be classified as a hurricane. The average
        diameter of a hurricane is 375 miles and extends up 40,000 feet above
        the ocean. A hurricane can do great damage if it hits land. On average,
      five hurricanes each year threaten the eastern and southern United States.</p>
      <p>A
          tropical storm is a storm that forms over the ocean in the tropics
        and has winds between 39 and 73 miles per hour. Often when they move
    onto land, they lose strength.</p></td>
