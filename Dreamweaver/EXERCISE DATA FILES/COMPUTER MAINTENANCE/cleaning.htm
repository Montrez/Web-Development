    <td><p>An LCD (liquid crystal display) screen should be cleaned using a soft cotton cloth and a solution of water and isopropyl alcohol or a solution of water and vinegar. The solution should be applied to the cloth first instead of sprayed directly on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>To clean a keyboard, a can of compressed air can be used to spray in between the keys to push out dust and crumbs. Q-tips, a small flat screw driver, or Post-It notes can also be used to remove dust and crumbs from the keyboard.</p>
      <p>A can of compressed air can also be used to clean the back of the computer tower near the cooling fan vents.</p>
    <p>The exterior of a mouse can be cleaned using a damp soft cloth. If the mouse has a trackball, the trackball should be removed and wiped with a dry cloth, and the rollers inside cleaned with a cotton swab.</p></td>
