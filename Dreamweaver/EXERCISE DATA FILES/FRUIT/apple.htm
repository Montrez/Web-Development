      <p> Apples are a good source of fiber.</p>
      <p> One apple has 80 calories, no fat, 22g

      <p>Selection
      and Storage</p>
      <p> Apples should be firm and have smooth skin. Brown freckles
          on the surface on skin are caused by weather conditions but do not
        affect its flavor.</p>
      <p>Apples should be stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator
          to keep them crisp for a long time.</p>

        most popular ones are:</p>
      <p> Red Delicious. These are red, sweet, juicy apples
              that are best eaten raw as a snack, because they are not good for
          cooking.</p>
