      <p> Bananas are a good source of fiber, vitamin C, and potassium.</p>
      <p> One banana
              has 110 calories, no fat, 29g carbohydrates, 4g dietary fiber,
        1g protein, and no sodium.</p>
      <p>Selection and Storage</p>
      <p> A ripe banana is completely yellow. Green is not
        ripe enough and brown is too ripe.</p>
      <p>Bananas should be kept at room temperature
            in the open
                  air, not in a closed container. To ripen faster, place them
        in a paper bag. Once ripe, they can be kept in the refrigerator, where
          the skin will turn black but the inside will remain good to eat.</p>
      <p>Common
      Types</p>
      <p> Cavendish bananas. This is the most common variety, the kind
        that most consumers buy and eat.</p>
      <p> Red bananas. These are short, fat bananas
            that have a reddish skin and are pink inside. They taste sweeter
        than Cavendish bananas.</p>
      <p> Apple bananas. These are also short, fat bananas and
              have an aftertaste that resembles the flavor of an apple.</p>
      <p> Plantains. Plantains
              are large and green. They are usually cooked because they are very
                starchy.</p></td>
