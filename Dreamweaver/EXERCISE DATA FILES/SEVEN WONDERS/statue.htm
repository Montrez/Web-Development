    <td><p>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was a 40 foot statue constructed of ivory
        and gold showing the Greek father of gods Zeus (Jupiter) on his throne.
        This is the statue in whose honor the Ancient Olympic games were held and
        which marked the site of the original Olympic games in the 400s B.C. It
        was located at the ancient town of Olympia, on the west coast of modern
        Greece (west of Athens). It was sculpted by the Athenian sculptor, Pheidias.
      </p>      <p>The temple of Zeus was designed and built in 450 B.C. and Pheidias began
        working on the sculpture for the temple around 440 B.C. He developed
        a technique for building enormous gold and ivory statues and sculpted
        and carved the different pieces of the statue in his workshop that still
        exists in Olympia today. The completed statue barely fit in the temple.
        The base was 20 feet wide and 3 feet high and the statue was 40 feet
        tall. Zeus' robe and sandals were made of gold and his throne was decorated
        with gold, precious stones, ebony, and ivory.</p>
      <p>All traces of the statue is lost except for reproduction on coins, which
        is not totally accurate. In the first century A.D., the Roman emperor
        Caligula attempted to transport the statue to Rome. He was unable to
        do this because the scaffolding built by his workmen collapsed. The temple
        of Zeus was closed when the Olympic games were banned in A.D. 391 by
        the emperor Theodosius I. Olympia was struck by earthquakes, landslides
        and floods, and the temple was damaged by fire in the fifth century A.D.
        Earlier, the statue had been transported by wealthy Greeks to a palace
        in Constantinople. It survived there until it was destroyed by a severe
        fire in A.D. 462. Today nothing remains at the site of the old temple
        except rocks and debris, the foundation of the buildings, and fallen
        columns.</p>
