    <td><p>The Pyramids of Egypt consist of a group of three pyramids: Khufu, Khafra,
        and Menkaura. It is the oldest wonder (estimated date of completion is
        2680 B.C.) and the only wonder to survive today. The pyramids are located
        at the city of Giza, a necropolis of ancient Memphis, and today part of
        Greater Cairo, Egypt. The pyramids are gigantic stone structures that were
        built by the great Ancient Egyptian civilization off the west bank of the
        Nile as tombs for their Kings, which each pyramid is named after.
      </p>      <p>The largest pyramid is the Great Pyramid of Khufu (Cheops). It had an
        original estimated height of 481 feet, and now is approximately 450 feet.
        For more than 43 centuries it ranked as the tallest structure on Earth.
        The monument was built by the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu of the Fourth Dynasty
        around the year 2560 B.C. to serve as his tomb when he died. The project
        took over 20 years to finish. The pyramid base has sides 751 feet long
        and a sloping angle of approximately 51 degrees. The structure consists
        of approximately 2 million blocks of stone with the average weight of
        each being 2.5 tons.</p>
      <p>The pyramids entrance is on the north face. There are a number of corridors,
        galleries, and escape shafts in the pyramid. The King's chamber is located
        at the heart of the pyramid and has red granite interior walls. There
        is a stone over the doorway that is 10 feet long by 8 feet wide that
        is approximately 4 feet thick. Today, all the pyramids are in an enclosed
    area along with the Sphinx.</p></td>
