    <td><p>The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was a temple made of marble that was
        over 400 feet long with over 100 60-feet high columns. It was decorated
        with many works of art including bronze statues sculpted by artists such
        as Pheidias, Polycleitus, Kresilas, and Phradmon. It was built in honor
        of the Greek goddess of hunting and wild nature. It was sponsored by the
        Lydian king Croesus and was designed by the Greek architect Chersiphron.
        It was built around 550 B.C.
      </p>      <p>The temple served as both a marketplace and a religious institution.
        It was visited by merchants, tourists, artisans, and kings who would
        sometimes share their profits (statuettes, earrings, bracelets, etc.)
        with the goddess.</p>
      <p>It was first destroyed in 356 B.C. by a man named Herostratus, who burned
        the temple to the ground in an attempt to immortalize his name. It was
        restored over the next two decades. It was again destroyed in A.D. 262
        by invading Goths. The Ephesians vowed to rebuild the temple, but most
        Ephesians had converted to Christianity by that time and the religious
        importance of the temple was gone. It was finally torn down in A.D. 401
        by St. John Chrysostom, and the city of Esphesus was later deserted.</p>
