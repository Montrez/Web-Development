    <td><p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon was a palace with legendary gardens built on the banks of the Euphrates River (near Baghdad, Iraq) by King Nebuchadnezzar
        II around 600 B.C. to please his queen, Amuhia. The terraced gardens are
    also associated with the mythical Assyrian queen, Semiramis.</p>
    <p>The most descriptive accounts of the Gardens came from Greek historians. There is no mention of the Hanging Gardens in any Babylonian Records. Archeologists
      are still trying to reach a conclusion about the actual location of the
      gardens, but they surmise that they were layed out atop a vaulted building
    with an irrigation well. The terraces were said to rise 75 to 300 feet.</p>
    <p>The Walls of Babylon, also built by Nebuchadnezzar, are sometimes referred
      to as the second (or seventh) wonder instead of the Hanging Gardens of
      Babylon.</p>
