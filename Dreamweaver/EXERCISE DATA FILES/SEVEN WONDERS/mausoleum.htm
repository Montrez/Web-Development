    <td><p>The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus was a beautiful 140 feet high tomb of
        King Maussollos, Persian satrap of Caria, in the city of Bodrum on the
        Aegean Sea in south-west Turkey. King Maussollos reigned the kingdom of
        Caria from 377 to 353 B.C. The construction of his tomb was conceived by
        his wife, Queen Artemisia, and it was completed around 350 B.C. He died
        three years prior to the completion and she died one year after it.
      </p>      <p>The Mausoleum was 120 feet by 100 feet. There was a podium that was
        decorated with statues. The burial chamber was decorated with gold and
        the podium was surrounded by Ionic columns. The roof was pyramid-shaped
        and was also decorated with statues. The statues were life-size statues
        of people, lions, horses, and other animals sculpted by the Greek sculptors
        Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas, and Timotheus. On top of his tomb was a statue
        of a chariot pulled by four horses.</p>
      <p>The Mausoleum remained in good condition for 16 centuries, and then
        an earthquake caused some damage to the roof and colonnade. In 1494,
        Knights of St. John of Malta invaded the region and used the stones of
        the Mausoleum to build a castle. By 1522, almost every block of the Mausoleum
        had been disassembled for use in the construction of their castle. The
        castle still stands today in Bodrum and pieces of the polished stone
        and marbled blocks from the Mausoleum can be spotted within the structure.</p>
      <p>Only the foundation remains at the original site of the Mausoleum. Some
        of the sculptures survived and are on display today at the British Museum
        in London.</p>
